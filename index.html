                <P>It’s been another demanding year for organisations in an environment beset by the pandemic, economic uncertainty and, more latterly, intensifying supply chain issues and disruption. If anything, 2021 has been just as tough as 2020 was!

                    Thinking back to this time last year, most of us were looking forward to getting out of 2020 and hoping that 2021 would be a more normal year. It wasn’t. And it seems likely that 2022 will not be straightforward either.
                    
                    That said, there are positives to celebrate. Organisations have continued to show huge resilience and determination, adapting according to market needs and maintaining their commitment to the service agenda. For that, customer service leaders and their teams deserve great credit.
                    
                    But the fact is the outlook remains challenging. The same levels of energy and professionalism will be needed next year to keep serving customers and stay true to the organisation’s values and purpose</P>

However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </p>
